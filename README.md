My blog is currently generated from markdown files using a home-made script.
It's little more than a wrapper around [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) plus a few
things specific to my use case (such as support for 2 languages), so I don't
really see the value in open-sourcing it right now. Furthermore building your
own website from scratch is one of the most fun and rewarding things you can
do. Finally if you like the minimal approach of blogging with no bells and
whistles but don't feel like creating it from scratch make sure to give
https://bearblog.dev/ a try.
