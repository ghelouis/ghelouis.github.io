<h1 class="title">Small IT survival guide</h1>
<p class="date">June 04, 2023</p>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Small (or not) guide, tips and good practises to survive in the
digital world. This page will be updated regularly.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h2 id="internet">Internet</h2>
<p>Recommended web browser (<a
href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/what-is-a-browser/">what
is it?</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>.
Open-source and maintained by the non-profit organisation Mozilla.
Respectful of user‚Äôs privacy as well as open web standards. As a bonus I
really like its <a
href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">reader
view</a> which displays text content only from websites, thereby
removing all that superfluous clutter sadly too common nowadays. My
blog‚Äôs minimalist theme was greatly inspired by it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock
Origin</a>, an open-source adblocker, essential nowadays, not to be
confused with the myriad of lesser clones;</li>
<li><a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox
Containers</a>. Enables compartmentalising online accounts in
colour-coded tabs. Extremely simple to use. Useful to avoid being
tracked, just create a container and assign it a website for it to
always open inside. Cookies are then restricted to that container and
invisible to the outside. I personally use it for all websites requiring
me to log in (for instance Facebook or Google). It‚Äôs also useful to
interact with multiple accounts at the same time (say two Gmail
addresses).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cookies-and-private-browsing">Cookies and private browsing</h3>
<p>Most websites use techniques such as cookies to track you and serve
targeted advertising. I tend to browse privately by default. In this
mode cookies are temporary and discarded when the browser is closed. If
I need to keep pages open across multiple sessions and keep them in my
history I use normal navigation. Finally for websites where I prefer to
stay logged in I use the Firefox Containers extension mentioned above
(one container per site).</p>
<p>Beware, none of those techniques are foolproof. User tracking is a
constant game of cat and mouse, it could be the topic of an entire
article. You can be tracked without ever logging in to a website, simply
by looking at the information transmitted by your browser and creating a
unique fingerprint (screen dimensions, installed extensions‚Ä¶). Look up
‚Äúbrowser fingerprinting‚Äù to find out more about this topic.</p>
<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimum 10 or 12 characters long with ideally a few uppercase
letters and special characters</li>
<li>Have a different password for each website or service</li>
</ul>
<p>A few techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Method 1: use a password manager such as <a
href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePass</a>. These can generate long
random passwords and only require you to remember your master
password.</li>
<li>Method 2: use a single password coupled to a small algorithm that
you‚Äôll apply for each site or service. For example append a prefix from
the first two letters of the website one step back in the alphabet and a
suffix from the same letters one step forward: <code>topSecret007</code>
+ <code>gmail</code> = <code>FLtopSecret007HN</code>. For Facebook the
password would be <code>EZtopSecret007GB</code>. Your imagination is the
limit :)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fa-2-factor-authentication">2FA (2 Factor Authentication)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enable wherever possible, particularly on your most sensitive
accounts;</li>
<li>Prefer the QR code scan method which generates a rotating pin (TOTP
in technical terms, for Time-based One-Time Password). Helps not to be
blocked if you travel and can‚Äôt receive an SMS;</li>
<li>Recommended TOTP apps: Google Authenticator, Authy or Aegis which is
open-source and easy to backup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installing-a-new-software">Installing a new software</h2>
<p>To avoid installing a virus or other kinds of malware it is important
to always get a new software from a trusted source. Usually its official
website or the App Stores from your operating system. Users of Linux
(the topic of one of my <a
href="https://ghelouis.fr/en/give-linux-a-try">previous articles</a>)
won‚Äôt have these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>As to the question of which software to choose amongst several
alternatives, it all depends on your priorities: features, price,
interoperability? As for myself I have a strong tendency to default to
free and open-source ones (a topic I covered in <a
href="https://ghelouis.fr/en/what-is-free-software">this past
article</a>).</p>
<h2 id="backups-pc">Backups (PC)</h2>
<p>Nobody is free from getting potentially stolen from, spilled coffee
or simply having a hard-drive give up on its life. Best to act now than
regret it later.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do a regular incremental and encrypted backup. Incremental: after
the first big backup the next ones will only record the latest changes.
Encrypted: someone getting access to this backup won‚Äôt be able to read
its content.</li>
<li>The state of the art consists of having two backups: one at home
(for instance on a hard-drive) and one at a different place (for
instance in the cloud). But one backup is already a decent start.</li>
<li>There are many tools and they will depend on your system,
preferences and technical skills. I will let you do your own research.
For the most curious, know that I use <a
href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> but it‚Äôs probably not what
you want to use unless you‚Äôre familiar with the command line :)</li>
<li>Always check that the backup is sound: restore a file from time to
time just to make sure everything works as expected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="good-security-practises">Good security practises</h2>
<p>The previous tips should already help you be in good control of your
digital life. Here‚Äôs some more bits of advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your system and software up to date. New features often come
with security patches inside of an update;</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt plug in random USB keys (for instance found on the
ground);</li>
<li>Never write down or share your passwords;</li>
<li>If you find yourself in a weird or suddenly urgent situation take
your time to assess what is happening. A call notifies you of fraudulent
transactions in Nigeria? Are you being asked to perform certain actions
or relinquish personal information? In doubt best to call back your bank
yourself at the contact number that you know to be correct.</li>
<li>Most scams or password leaks are actually facilitated by users
themselves! Always be cautious before sharing private or confidential
information. Bogus links in emails or SMS are another classic technique.
It is super easy to copy a website‚Äôs entire appearance and serve it from
a similar or innocent looking URL (<a
href="https://ghelouis.fr/en/u-lost">google-search.com</a> instead of <a
href="https://google.com">google.com</a> for example). In doubt always
refer to the website or contact that you know to be the official
one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smartphones-android">Smartphones (Android)</h2>
<p>I own an Android, so I will focus on this type of phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web browsing: Firefox + the uBlock Origin extension. Same benefits
as listed higher up. You can also play YouTube videos with you screen
locked.</li>
<li>Recent Android versions enable you to block authorisations and
notifications from single app‚Äôs settings. Fairly useful, in general
these controls are restricted or incomplete inside the apps
themselves.</li>
<li>Doing regular backups applies here as well. Everything depends on
what you want to backup and how. For example my contacts app has an
export feature. Keeping photos safe is also a good idea. Personally I
export everything I value on my laptop. This way my PC backup also has
my phone‚Äôs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protips">Protips</h2>
<p>In Firefox you can access bookmarks via custom keywords and even
inject parameters. For instance typing <code>y kittens</code> in my
address bar does a search on YouTube for kittens. This is powered by the
following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyword: <code>y</code></li>
<li>URL:
<code>https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>%s</code> is replaced by what gets typed after the keyword,
in this case <code>kittens</code>. I‚Äôve got a fair amount of shortcuts
like this, all you need to do is analyse the URL. Another example I use
frequently: <code>enfr something</code> and
<code>fren quelque chose</code> to translate to and from English from
French, using <a
href="https://www.wordreference.com">wordreference.com</a>. Or also
<code>wiki something</code> to search on Wikipedia.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stay curious about your tools‚Äô inner workings. IT is part of our
daily life, it is now more important than ever to understand the basics
of this world. Who knows, you might even start enjoying it :)</p>
<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ssi.gouv.fr/en/</a>: The ANSSI
(French national cybersecurity agency) has got great resources and
guides, for private individuals and professionals alike;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en">cnil.fr/en</a>: Website of the CNIL
(French commission of IT and individual liberties). Good content on the
topics of personal data and online privacy (not sure how much of it is
available in English though, sorry).</li>
