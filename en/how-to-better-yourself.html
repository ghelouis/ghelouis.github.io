<h1 class="title">How to better yourself</h1>
<p class="date">January 18, 2023</p>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This article will present a method allowing you to progress regularly
and consistently. Sports will be used as an example but the concepts
will easily transcribe to other domains. Being able to foresee the
future is among the characteristics that separate humans from animals.
This capacity is going to help us counter our impulses and the desire
for instant gratification ever so present these days. How could we trick
the brain to perform on the long term? Let’s have a look.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-a-routine">Set up a routine</h2>
<p>Most important is to establish a routine. Let’s have a look at
bodyweight exercises for example. Carrying out a couple of push-ups and
three squats every other day might seem trivial (if not replace this
example by something that’s easy for you). Once the routine in place,
try and maintain it for several weeks or even a month. At this stage
consistency is key, not difficulty. It could be tempting to cut corners
but best to progress slowly rather than give up after two weeks of
intense effort. Implementing a routine is a prerequisite, it is the
solid base holding all the rest together.</p>
<p>Asking yourself what to do and when requires effort from the brain.
Implementing a routine allows the removal of this barrier and a thus
increased chance of completing the sought-after activity. A good
approach is to pick a fixed time of the day, say 12 o’clock before lunch
time. Another idea is to append yourself to an existing routine like
brushing your teeth.</p>
<p>Finally, life is full of surprises and a day can suddenly force you
to cancel your routine. No need to panic, but in this case it is crucial
to immediately restore your habit from the next time. Skipping a routine
twice in a row is very bad and at risk of implementing this behaviour as
the new default… Oopsy ! Of course occasional holidays won’t harm
anyone, as long as they are planned, voluntary and time-constrained.</p>
<h2 id="establish-a-progress-grid">Establish a progress grid</h2>
<p>The next step consists of setting up a way to progress. Once the
routine solidly set and easy to do, time has come to increase its
difficulty. Best to go slowly and never push to the point of failure. To
once again minimise friction when the time comes, planning in advance
can be effective. For example coming up with the next week’s routines on
the previous week-end or conceiving a progress grid. Two times five
push-ups with a perception of ease at the end? Let’s do three times four
push-ups next time. The routine is best kept lasting a similar duration,
so for exercise if repetitions become too many it’s possible to increase
the difficulty. Of course this depends on your objectives and domain of
activity. The secret being to keep things doable up to difficult but
never impossible. This way the routine stays intact and you never have
to give up.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, this approach should allow to truly better oneself in
almost any domain. First of all set up a robust routine, so much part of
your daily life that you don’t even have to think about it. Next
establish a progress grid and a regular checks. Too easy? OK, let’s add
a push-up, a pull-up or one more lap! This article stayed generic on
purpose. For specific activities’ details the internet is full of
incredible resources. Nothing is more satisfying that setting up your
own routine with your goals and desired progress! This article was
heavily inspired by the progressive approach of calisthenics and street
workout. Now the time has come to improve yourself, let’s go!</p>
<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>

from the excellent Kurtzgesagt youtube channel</a>;</li>
<li>Paul Wade - Convict Conditioning (the bible of bodyweight exercise
enthusiasts, this book presents in an extremely clear and entertaining
way the importance of implementing a routine and steps of
progression).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonus-tips">Bonus: tips</h2>
<p>The perfect routine that fits you and your expectations will never be
produced in one day. It is thus normal to continuously improve it. Your
potential and the methods that work best for you will become more and
more easy to understand. A good idea is to record completed routines in
a notebook as well as the feeling at the end. Having a written trace
helps with staying on course and guiding the next steps. Finally it is
irrefutable proof of what you were able to achieve over the past period.
The next one must thus be at worst the same, at best of a higher
progression, yep, the goal is to improve!</p>
