<h1 class="title">What is free software?</h1>
<p class="date">December 18, 2019</p>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this time where information technologies take more and more space
in our lives, what behaviour can we adopt to maintain some sort of
control? Can we at all escape all those unknown algorithms that try to
optimize the profit of a couple of super-corporations? At first, let’s
dive into what a program is, exactly. Then, we will take a look at the
impact of licences on softwares. All of this will allow us to better
understand, as a user, what choices are in front of us when deciding on
a software.</p>
<h2 id="how-software-works">How software works</h2>
<p>What is a program (or software)? For a majority of the population, it
is a black box that sends emails, allows us to share photos or play
video games on our smartphones. But how does all of this work? Reality
is, all those possibilities have been conceived by someone, then
transcribed into computer instructions. This is called development or
programming. These instructions are nothing less than lines of text
written by someone using a programming language. Many of the latter
exist, a bit like spoken languages.</p>
<p>Example of code which once executed displays “Hello, world!”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">object</span> Main <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="fu">main</span><span class="op">(</span>args<span class="op">:</span> <span class="ex">Array</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="ex">String</span><span class="op">])</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="fu">println</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point comes an important step. Once software is written, we
need to be able to run it. However, a computer understands only binary
(sequence of 0 and 1) ! This is why a program must be compiled before it
can be run. The compilation being the translation of a source code to a
binary understandable by a computer.</p>

alt="A program must be compiled before it can be run." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A program must be compiled before it can
be run.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Installing a software usually means downloading the binary (.exe
extension in Windows). It is then possible to run it (usually by
double-clicking on the icon). Let’s take note that this binary file is
completely unreadable for a human being. A source code, on the other
hand, is at least clear for a developer. It is this very important
difference that will be of interest for us in the next section,
specifically the access to the original source code of a software.</p>
<h2 id="licences">Licences</h2>
<p>A developer or a company that publishes a software chooses or not to
divulge its source code. This is decided by the licence under which this
software is published. Without going into details of the many licences
that exist, let’s focus on a few key aspects. A program that doesn’t
give access to its source code is called proprietary. We can name for
example Photoshop for image processing or Microsoft Word for handling
text documents.</p>
<p><img src="../images/info.png" class="icon" alt="Info" /> Proprietary
software: the source code is kept private.</p>
<p>A second broad family of licences are the “open-source” ones. As you
might have guessed, those programs disclose their source code to the
public. Whoever wishes to read, try to understand or even compile them
himself can do so in complete freedom. The author is being actively
transparent.</p>
<p><img src="../images/info.png" class="icon" alt="Info" /> Open-source
software: the source code is available for anyone to read.</p>
<p>Let’s finally talk about a third type of licence (and the main topic
of this article): free software. Free as in freedom. Open-source is all
well and good, but how could we avoid someone simply grabbing the source
code and creating a proprietary software? Furthermore, an open-source
program is available to read but does not entail changing or sharing it.
So, let’s add the following possibilities: everyone can modify and share
the source code at will, all changes having to be upstreamed to the
original project. We just described what a free software is. A free
software is open-source, but the inverse is not always true.</p>
<p><img src="../images/info.png" class="icon" alt="Info" /> Free
software: the source code is available, anyone can modify and share it,
and all changes must be published openly under those same
conditions.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this with a few examples.</p>

<p>BSD is an example of an open-source project upon which Apple based
its operating system, MacOS.</p>
<p><img src="../images/warn.png" class="icon" alt="Warn" /> Let’s not
get confused: free software does not always mean free as in free beer.
Similarly, a proprietary software can very well be given out for
free.</p>
<p>Proprietary software are usually developed by companies who aim to
maximize their profits. It is how capitalism works. The problem is that
profit and user experience are not always aligned. Examples are legion.
For instance selling private user data (Facebook, Google), getting
locked up in a closed ecosystem (Apple), being tracked for advertisement
purposes… Or ending up being forced to upgrade and buy the next version
of a software. It is in fact the nature of proprietary softwares itself
that is the cause of all of this and triggers sooner or later some sort
of abuse. The creator finds himself having full power over the user. At
some point, a shift towards the creator begins to happen, all the while
undermining the end users.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we saw that the behaviour of a software lies in its
source code, the latter not being necessary to run a program. Software
not disclosing their source are called proprietary and are usually in
the hands of companies looking to maximize their profits. On the other
hand, free software is developed openly by communities, volunteers or
enthusiasts. For an end-user, opting for a proprietary software is
synonymous to trusting some company blindly (and forever). On the
contrary, choosing a free software means actively supporting a more
transparent and open world, community driven and where the end-users are
more likely to be respected.</p>
<p>Of course, the world is not black and white, and all proprietary
software is not to be avoided totally, nor all free software to be
adopted blindly. Some proprietary softwares don’t have a free
equivalent. Free software can also sometimes feel less polished than the
alternatives. What matters most is to be aware of the choice when
selecting a software. It is then possible to weigh up the pros and cons
rationally and in full knowledge. This choice matters even more when it
comes to choosing an operating system, this big program that runs all
the others! This is the reason why my <a
href="https://ghelouis.fr/en/give-linux-a-try">next article</a> will be
dedicated to Linux, a free alternative to the famous Windows.</p>
