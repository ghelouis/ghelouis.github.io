<h1>Pocket Chef</h1>
<p><img src="../images/pocket_chef_icon.png" alt="Icon of Pocket Chef" /></p>
<p>A recipe manager application, available for <a
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.ghelouis.pocketchef">Android</a>
and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-chef/id1536915775#?platform=iphone">iOS</a>.</p>

<p>I created Pocket Chef on my free time, having always been willing to publish
my own app. I like to cook and take notes left and right of recipes
gleaned here and there on the net or by word of mouth. The result being a pile
of notes on loose pieces of paper as well as on my computer and phone, the idea
of Pocket Chef started to grow in my mind.</p>
<p>With Pocket Chef a user can write and keep recipes with himself at all
times. Specific care has been given to the respect and interoperability of
data.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Attach one or more photos to a recipe</li>
  <li>ingredients, instructions, utensils and notes dedicated sections</li>
  <li>Adaptable number of people (multiplies ingredient quantities)</li>
  <li>Export/import a recipe</li>
  <li>Available in French and in English (adapts to the phone's language)</li>
  <li>No network connection is necessary, the content is only on the phone</li>
</ul>

<h2>An app that's open and respectful of the user</h2>
<p>The control of a user over its data (namely recipes) is a matter dear to my
heart. As such with Pocket Chef everything happens on the phone, nothing is
sent over the internet or gathered in any way. Moreover a recipe can easily be
exported or imported in a format extremely simple and readable by anyone (text
file, see the <a
  href="https://github.com/ghelouis/pocketchef/wiki/Recipe-format">wiki</a> of
the project for more).</p>
<p>This capability offers many possibilities and great freedom to the user.
Indeed, a recipe can easily be shared with someone else and even modified
outside of Pocket Chef. The app proves to be a tool at the service of the user
and not a closed ecosystem from which there is no escape.</p>


<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Pocket Chef is written entirely in Javascript (React Native) with <a
  href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a>.  Data is stored locally in an SQLite
database. With Expo no platform specific code needs to be written. </p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>Pocket Chef is free software and its source code is available on my github at this
address: <a href="https://github.com/ghelouis/pocketchef">https://github.com/ghelouis/pocketchef</a>.</p>
