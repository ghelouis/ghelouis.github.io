# Mac

## Tools

- linux-like package manager: brew

## Troubleshooting
- washed-out colors: cover the camera with your hand (caused by the automatic luminosity adjustment).

## Keybindings

- Move to the next window of the same app: Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Move focus to next window

## Protips

- Prevent random rearranging the order of desktops: System Prefs > Mission Control > uncheck `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use`
- Dock appearing on second screen even though it's the secondary? *Scrolling down* moves the dock to the current screen.
